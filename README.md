# Face Recognition Attendance System (FRAS)

This app is developed using React and faceapi.js. The faceapi.js library is built on top of tensorflow.js and it makes it easier to detect, analyze, and compare faces from an image. To improve the accuracy of the detection, the detection is made after multiple expression and captured such as happy, angry, neutral, surprized, sad, etc. It also contains gender detection using which additional check can be performed to improve the accuracy of the results.
